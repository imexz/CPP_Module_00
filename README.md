# CPP_Module_00
The goal of these modules is to give an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming using C++98.

This specific module introduces to Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff.

- Ex00: Write a program, which takes strings as arguments, converts them to uppercase and prints them to stdout.
- Ex01: Write a crappy awesome phonebook software.
- Ex02: Given a Account.hpp file, a tests.cpp file and a log file, understand how the Account class was implemented and recreate the missing Account.cpp file.
